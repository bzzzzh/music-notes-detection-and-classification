1.1 The LilyPond story
======================

Long before LilyPond had been used to engrave beautiful performance
scores, before it could create university course notes or even simple
melodies, before there was a community of users around the world or even
an essay on music engraving, LilyPond began with a question:

     Why does most computer output fail to achieve the beauty and
     balance of a hand-engraved score?

Some of the answers can be found by examining the two scores below.  The
first score is a beautiful hand-engraved score from 1950 and the second
is a modern, computer-engraved edition.

     Henle no.  666, ©2000:

   The notes here are identical, taken from Bach’s first Suite for solo
cello, but the appearance is different, especially if you print them out
and view them from a distance.  (The PDF version of this manual has
high-resolution images suitable for printing.)  Try reading or playing
from each of the scores and you will find that the hand-engraved score
is more enjoyable to use.  It has flowing lines and movement, and it
feels like a living, breathing piece of music, while the newer edition
seems cold and mechanical.

   It is hard to immediately see what makes the difference with the
newer edition.  Everything looks neat and tidy, possibly even “better”
because it looks more computerized and uniform.  This really puzzled us
for quite a while.  We wanted to improve computer notation, but we first
had to figure out what was wrong with it.

   The answer lies in the precise, mathematical uniformity of the newer
edition.  Find the bar line in the middle of each line: in the
hand-engraved score the position of these bar lines has some natural
variation, while in the newer version they line up almost perfectly.
This is shown in these simplified page layout diagrams, traced from the
hand-engraved (left) and computer-generated music (right):

[png]
   In the computer-generated output, even the individual note heads are
aligned in vertical columns, making the contour of the melody disappear
into a rigid grid of musical markings.

   There are other differences as well: in the hand-engraved edition the
vertical lines are all stronger, the slurs lie closer to the note heads,
and there is more variety in the slopes of the beams.  Although such
details may seem like nitpicking, the result is a score that is easier
to read.  In the computer-generated output, each line is nearly
identical and if the musician looks away for a moment she will be lost
on the page.

   LilyPond was designed to solve the problems we found in existing
software and to create beautiful music that mimics the finest
hand-engraved scores.

1.2 Engraving details
=====================

The art of music typography is called _(plate) engraving_, a term that
derives from the manual process of music printing(1).  Just a few
decades ago, sheet music was made by cutting and stamping the music into
a zinc or pewter plate in mirror image.  The plate would be inked, and
the depressions caused by the cutting and stamping would hold ink.  An
image was formed by pressing paper to the plate.  The stamping and
cutting was done completely by hand and making a correction was
cumbersome, so the engraving had to be nearly perfect in one go.
Engraving was a highly specialized skill; a craftsman had to complete
around five years of training before earning the title of master
engraver, and another five years of experience were necessary to become
truly skilled.

[jpg]
   LilyPond is inspired by traditional manual engravings published by
European music publishers in and towards the end of the first half of
the twentieth century, including Bärenreiter, Duhem, Durand, Hofmeister,
Peters, and Schott.  This is sometimes regarded as the peak of
traditional musical engraving practice.  As we have studied these
editions we have learned a great deal about what goes into a
well-engraved score, and the aspects that we wanted to imitate in
LilyPond.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Early European printers explored several processes, including
hand-carved wooden blocks, movable type, and engraved sheets of thin
metal.  Typesetting had the advantage of being more easily corrected and
facilitating the inclusion of text and lyrics, but only engraving
offered the ability to do unimpeded layout and unanticipated notation.
In the end, hand-engraved scores became the standard for all printed
music, with the exception of some hymnals and songbooks where
typesetting was justified by its ease and economy, even into the
twentieth century.

Music fonts
-----------

The images below illustrate some differences between traditional
engraving and typical computer output.  The left picture shows a scan of
a flat symbol from a hand-engraved Bärenreiter edition, while the right
picture depicts a symbol from an edition of the same music published in
2000.  Although both images are printed in the same shade of ink, the
earlier version looks darker: the staff lines are heavier, and the
Bärenreiter flat has a bold, almost voluptuous rounded look.  The right
scan, on the other hand, has thinner lines and a straight layout with
sharp corners.

   When we wanted to write a computer program to create music
typography, there were no musical fonts freely available that could
match the elegance of our favorite scores.  Undeterred, we created a
font of musical symbols, relying on nice printouts of hand-engraved
music.  The experience helped develop a typographical taste, and it made
us appreciate subtle design details.  Without that experience, we would
not have realized how ugly the fonts were that we admired at first.

   Below is a sample of two music fonts: the upper set is the default
font in the Sibelius software (the _Opus_ font), and the lower set is
our own LilyPond font.

[png]
   The LilyPond symbols are heavier and their weight is more consistent,
which makes them easier to read.  Fine endings, such as the ones on the
sides of the quarter rest, should not end in sharp points, but rather in
rounded shapes.  This is because sharp corners of the punching dies are
fragile and quickly wear out when stamping in metal.  Taken together,
the blackness of the font must be carefully tuned together with the
thickness of lines, beams and slurs to give a strong yet balanced
overall impression.

   Also, notice that our half-note head is not elliptic but slightly
diamond shaped.  The vertical stem of a flat symbol is slightly brushed,
becoming wider at the top.  The sharp and the natural are easier to
distinguish from a distance because their angled lines have different
slopes and the vertical strokes are heavier.

Optical spacing
---------------

In spacing, the distribution of space should reflect the durations
between notes.  However, as we saw in the Bach Suite above, many modern
scores adhere to the durations with mathematical precision, which leads
to poor results.  In the next example a motif is printed twice: the
first time using exact mathematical spacing, and the second with
corrections.  Which do you prefer?

 [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]
 [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]
   Each bar in the fragment only uses notes that are played in a
constant rhythm.  The spacing should reflect that.  Unfortunately, the
eye deceives us a little; not only does it notice the distance between
note heads, it also takes into account the distance between consecutive
stems.  As a result, the notes of an up-stem/down-stem combination
should be put farther apart, and the notes of a down-stem/up-stem
combination should be put closer together, all depending on the combined
vertical positions of the notes.  The lower two measures are printed
with this correction, the upper two measures, however, form
down-stem/up-stem clumps of notes.  A master engraver would adjust the
spacing as needed to please the eye.

   The spacing algorithms in LilyPond even take the barlines into
account, which is why the final up-stem in the properly spaced example
has been given a little more space before the barline to keep it from
looking crowded.  A down-stem would not need this adjustment.


File: lilypond-essay.info,  Node: Ledger lines,  Next: Optical sizing,  Prev: Optical spacing,  Up: Engraving details

Ledger lines
------------

Ledger lines present a typographical challenge: they make it more
difficult to space musical symbols close together and they must be clear
enough to identify the pitch at a glance.  In the example below, we see
that ledger lines should be thicker than normal staff lines and that an
expert engraver will shorten a ledger line to allow closer spacing with
accidentals.  We have included this feature in LilyPond’s engraving.

File: lilypond-essay.info,  Node: Optical sizing,  Next: Why work so hard?,  Prev: Ledger lines,  Up: Engraving details

Optical sizing
--------------

Music may need to be printed in a range of sizes.  Originally, this was
accomplished by creating punching dies in each of the required sizes,
which meant that each die was designed to look its best at that size.
With the advent of digital fonts, a single outline can be mathematically
scaled to any size, which is very convenient, but at the smaller sizes
the glyphs will appear very light.

   In LilyPond, we have created fonts in a range of weights,
corresponding to a range of music sizes.  This is a LilyPond engraving
at staff size 26:

[png]
and this is the same engraving set at staff size 11, then magnified by
236% to print at the same size as the previous example:

[png]
At smaller sizes, LilyPond uses proportionally heavier lines so the
music will still read well.

   This also allows staves of different sizes to coexist peacefully when
used together on the same page:

Why work so hard?
-----------------

Musicians are usually more absorbed with performing than with studying
the looks of a piece of music, so nitpicking typographical details may
seem academic.  But it is not.  Sheet music is performance material:
everything is done to aid the musician in letting her perform better,
and anything that is unclear or unpleasant to read is a hindrance.

   Traditionally engraved music uses bold symbols on heavy staff to
create a strong, well-balanced look that stands out well when the music
is far away from the reader: for example, if it is on a music stand.  A
careful distribution of white space allows music to be set very tightly
without crowding symbols together.  The result minimizes the number of
page turns, which is a great advantage.

   This is a common characteristic of typography.  Layout should be
pretty, not only for its own sake, but especially because it helps the
reader in his task.  For sheet music this is of double importance
because musicians have a limited amount of attention.  The less
attention they need for reading, the more they can focus on playing the
music.  In other words, better typography translates to better
performances.

   These examples demonstrate that music typography is an art that is
subtle and complex, and that producing it requires considerable
expertise, which musicians usually do not have.  LilyPond is our effort
to bring the graphical excellence of hand-engraved music to the computer
age, and make it available to normal musicians.  We have tuned our
algorithms, font-designs, and program settings to produce prints that
match the quality of the old editions we love to see and love to play
from.

1.3 Automated engraving
=======================

Here we describe what is required to create software that can mimic the
layout of engraved scores: a method of describing good layouts to the
computer and a lot of detailed comparisons with real engravings.

Beauty contests
---------------

How do we actually make formatting decisions?  In other words, which of
the three configurations should we choose for the following slur?

 [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]
   There are a few books on the art of music engraving available.
Unfortunately, they contain simple rules of thumb and some examples.
Such rules can be instructive, but they are a far cry from an algorithm
that we could readily implement in a computer.  Following the
instructions from literature leads to algorithms with lots of hand-coded
exceptions.  Doing all this case analysis is a lot of work, and often
not all cases are covered completely:

[.jpg]
   (Image source: Ted Ross, _The Art of Music Engraving_)

   Rather than trying to write detailed layout rules for every possible
scenario, we only have to describe the objectives well enough that
LilyPond can judge the attractiveness of several alternatives.  Then,
for each possible configuration we compute an ugliness score and we
choose the least ugly configuration.

   For example, here are three possible slur configurations, and
LilyPond has given each one a score in ‘ugly points’.  The first example
gets 15.39 points for grazing one of the noteheads:

 [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]
   The second one is nicer, but the slur doesn’t start or end on the
note heads.  It gets 1.71 points for the left side and 9.37 points for
the right side, plus another 2 points because the slur ascends while the
melody descends for a total of 13.08 ugly points:

 [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]
   The final slur gets 10.04 points for the gap on the right and 2
points for the upward slope, but it is the most attractive of the three
configurations, so LilyPond selects this one:

 [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]
   This technique is quite general, and is used to make optimal
decisions for beam configurations, ties and dots in chords, line breaks,
and page breaks.  The results of these decisions can be judged by
comparison to real engravings.

Improvement by benchmarking
---------------------------

LilyPond’s output has improved gradually over time, and it continues to
improve by comparing its output to hand-engraved scores.

   For example, here is one line of a benchmark piece from a
hand-engraved edition (Bärenreiter BA320):

[png]
and the same quotation as engraved by a very old version of LilyPond
(version 1.4, May 2001):

[png]
The LilyPond 1.4 output is certainly readable, but close comparison with
the hand-engraved score showed a lot of errors in the formatting
details:

[png]
   • there is too much space before the time signature
   • the stems of the beamed notes are too long
   • the second and fourth measures are too narrow
   • the slur is awkward-looking
   • the trill marks are too big
   • the stems are too thin

(There were also two missing note heads, several missing editorial
annotations, and an incorrect pitch!)

   By adjusting the layout rules and font design, the output has
improved considerably.  Compare the same reference score and the output
from the current version of LilyPond (2.20.0):

[png]
 [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]
The current output is not a clone of the reference edition, but it is
much closer to publication quality that the earlier output.

Getting things right
--------------------

We can also measure LilyPond’s ability to make music engraving decisions
automatically by comparing LilyPond’s output to the output of a
commercial software product.  In this case we have chosen Finale 2008,
which is one of the most popular commercial score writers, particularly
in North America.  Sibelius is its major rival and appears to be
especially strong in the European market.

   For our comparison we selected Bach’s Fugue in G minor from the
Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I, BWV 861, whose opening subject is

 [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

   We made our comparison by engraving the last seven measures of the
piece (28–34) in Finale and LilyPond.  This is the point in the piece
where the subject returns in a three-part stretto and leads into the
closing section.  In the Finale version, we have resisted the temptation
to make any adjustments to the default output because we are trying to
show the things that each software package gets right without
assistance.  The only major edits that we made were adjusting the page
size to match this essay and forcing the music onto two systems to make
the comparison easier.  By default Finale would have engraved two
systems of three measures each and a final, full-width system containing
a single measure.

   Many of the differences between the two engravings are visible in
measures 28–29, as shown here with Finale first and LilyPond second:

[png]
 [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]
   Some shortcomings in the unedited Finale output include:
   • Most of the beams extend too far off the staff.  A beam that points
     towards the center of the staff should have a length of about one
     octave, but engravers shorten this when the beam points away from
     the staff in multi-voice music.  The Finale beaming can easily be
     improved with their Patterson Beams plug-in, but we elected to skip
     that step for this example.
   • Finale doesn’t adjust the positions of interlocking note heads,
     which makes the music extremely difficult to read when the upper
     and lower voices exchange positions temporarily:

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

   • Finale has placed all of the rests at fixed heights on the staff.
     The user is free to adjust them as needed, but the software makes
     no attempt to consider the content of the other voice.  As luck
     would have it, there are no true collisions between notes and rests
     in this example, but that has more to do with the positions of the
     notes than the rest.  In other words, Bach deserves more credit for
     avoiding a complete collision than Finale does.

   This example is not intended to suggest that Finale cannot be used to
produce publication-quality output.  On the contrary, in the hands of a
skilled user it can and does, but it requires skill and time.  One of
the fundamental differences between LilyPond and commercial scorewriters
is that LilyPond hopes to reduce the amount of human intervention to an
absolute minimum, while other packages try to provide an attractive
interface in which to make these types of edits.

   One particularly glaring omission we found from Finale is a missing
flat in measure 33:

[png]
The flat symbol is required to cancel out the natural in the same
measure, but Finale misses it because it occurred in a different voice.
So in addition to running a beaming plug-in and checking the spacing on
the noteheads and rests, the user must also check each measure for
cross-voice accidentals to avoid interrupting a rehearsal over an
engraving error.

   If you are interested in examining these examples in more detail, the
full seven-measure excerpt can be found at the end of this essay along
with four different published engravings.  Close examination reveals
that there is some acceptable variation among the hand-engravings, but
that LilyPond compares reasonably well to that acceptable range.  There
are still some shortcomings in the LilyPond output, for example, it
appears a bit too aggressive in shortening some of the stems, so there
is room for further development and fine-tuning.

   Of course, typography relies on human judgment of appearance, so
people cannot be replaced completely.  However, much of the dull work
can be automated.  If LilyPond solves most of the common situations
correctly, this will be a huge improvement over existing software.  Over
the course of years, the software can be refined to do more and more
things automatically, so manual overrides are less and less necessary.
Where manual adjustments are needed, LilyPond’s structure has been
designed with that flexibility in mind.

1.4 Building software
=====================

This section describes some of the programming decisions that we made
when designing LilyPond.

* Music representation::
* What symbols to engrave?::
* Flexible architecture::

Music representation
--------------------

Ideally, the input format for any high-level formatting system is an
abstract description of the content.  In this case, that would be the
music itself.  This poses a formidable problem: how can we define what
music really is?  Instead of trying to find an answer, we have reversed
the question.  We write a program capable of producing sheet music, and
adjust the format to be as lean as possible.  When the format can no
longer be trimmed down, by definition we are left with content itself.
Our program serves as a formal definition of a music document.

   The syntax is also the user-interface for LilyPond, hence it is easy
to type:

     {
       c'4 d'8
     }

to create a quarter note on middle C (C1) and an eighth note on the D
above middle C (D1).

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

   On a microscopic scale, such syntax is easy to use.  On a larger
scale, syntax also needs structure.  How else can you enter complex
pieces like symphonies and operas?  The structure is formed by the
concept of music expressions: by combining small fragments of music into
larger ones, more complex music can be expressed.  For example

     f'4
      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

Simultaneous notes can be constructed by enclosing them with ‘<<’ and
‘>>’:

     <<c4 d4 e4>>

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

This expression is put in sequence by enclosing it in curly braces
‘{ ... }’:

     { f4 <<c4 d4 e4>> }

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

The above is also an expression, and so it may be combined again with
another simultaneous expression (a half note) using ‘<<’, ‘\\’, and
‘>>’:

     << g2 \\ { f4 <<c4 d4 e4>> } >>

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

   Such recursive structures can be specified neatly and formally in a
context-free grammar.  The parsing code is also generated from this
grammar.  In other words, the syntax of LilyPond is clearly and
unambiguously defined.

   User-interfaces and syntax are what people see and deal with most.
They are partly a matter of taste, and also the subject of much
discussion.  Although discussions on taste do have their merit, they are
not very productive.  In the larger picture of LilyPond, the importance
of input syntax is small: inventing neat syntax is easy, while writing
decent formatting code is much harder.  This is also illustrated by the
line-counts for the respective components: parsing and representation
take up less than 10% of the source code.

   When designing the structures used in LilyPond, we made some
different decisions than are apparent in other software.  Consider the
hierarchical nature of music notation:

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

   In this case, there are pitches grouped into chords that belong to
measures, which belong to staves.  This resembles a tidy structure of
nested boxes:

[png]
   Unfortunately, the structure is tidy because it is based on some
excessively restrictive assumptions.  This becomes apparent if we
consider a more complicated musical example:

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

   In this example, staves start and stop at will, voices jump around
between staves, and the staves have different time signatures.  Many
software packages would struggle with reproducing this example because
they are built on the nested box structure.  With LilyPond, on the other
hand, we have tried to keep the input format and the structure as
flexible as possible.

What symbols to engrave?
------------------------

The formatting process decides where to place symbols.  However, this
can only be done once it is decided _what_ symbols should be printed –
in other words, what notation to use.

   Common music notation is a system of recording music that has evolved
over the past 1000 years.  The form that is now in common use dates from
the early Renaissance.  Although the basic form (i.e., note heads on a
5-line staff) has not changed, the details still evolve to express the
innovations of contemporary notation.  Hence, common music notation
encompasses some 500 years of music.  Its applications range from
monophonic melodies to monstrous counterpoints for a large orchestra.

   How can we get a grip on such a seven-headed beast, and force it into
the confines of a computer program?  Our solution is to break up the
problem of notation (as opposed to engraving, i.e., typography) into
digestible and programmable chunks: every type of symbol is handled by a
separate module, a so-called plug-in.  Each plug-in is completely
modular and independent, so each can be developed and improved
separately.  Such plug-ins are called ‘engraver’s, by analogy with
craftsmen who translate musical ideas to graphic symbols.

   In the following example, we start out with a plug-in for note heads,
the ‘Note_heads_engraver’.

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

Then a ‘Staff_symbol_engraver’ adds the staff,

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

the ‘Clef_engraver’ defines a reference point for the staff,

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

and the ‘Stem_engraver’ adds stems.

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

The ‘Stem_engraver’ is notified of any note head coming along.  Every
time one (or more, for a chord) note head is seen, a stem object is
created and connected to the note head.  By adding engravers for beams,
slurs, accents, accidentals, bar lines, time signature, and key
signature, we get a complete piece of notation.

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

   This system works well for monophonic music, but what about
polyphony?  In polyphonic notation, many voices can share a staff.

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

   In this situation, the accidentals and staff are shared, but the
stems, slurs, beams, etc., are private to each voice.  Hence, engravers
should be grouped.  The engravers for note heads, stems, slurs, etc., go
into a group called ‘Voice context’, while the engravers for key,
accidental, bar, etc., go into a group called ‘Staff context’.  In the
case of polyphony, a single Staff context contains more than one Voice
context.  Similarly, multiple Staff contexts can be put into a single
Score context.  The Score context is the top level notation context.

Flexible architecture
---------------------

When we started, we wrote the LilyPond program entirely in the C++
programming language; the program’s functionality was set in stone by
the developers.  That proved to be unsatisfactory for a number of
reasons:

   • When LilyPond makes mistakes, users need to override formatting
     decisions.  Therefore, the user must have access to the formatting
     engine.  Hence, rules and settings cannot be fixed by us at
     compile-time but must be accessible for users at run-time.

   • Engraving is a matter of visual judgment, and therefore a matter of
     taste.  As knowledgeable as we are, users can disagree with our
     personal decisions.  Therefore, the definitions of typographical
     style must also be accessible to the user.

   • Finally, we continually refine the formatting algorithms, so we
     need a flexible approach to rules.  The C++ language forces a
     certain method of grouping rules that cannot readily be applied to
     formatting music notation.

   These problems have been addressed by integrating an interpreter for
the Scheme programming language and rewriting parts of LilyPond in
Scheme.  The current formatting architecture is built around the notion
of graphical objects, described by Scheme variables and functions.  This
architecture encompasses formatting rules, typographical style and
individual formatting decisions.  The user has direct access to most of
these controls.

   Scheme variables control layout decisions.  For example, many
graphical objects have a direction variable that encodes the choice
between up and down (or left and right).  Here you see two chords, with
accents and arpeggios.  In the first chord, the graphical objects have
all directions down (or left).  The second chord has all directions up
(right).

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

The process of formatting a score consists of reading and writing the
variables of graphical objects.  Some variables have a preset value.
For example, the thickness of many lines – a characteristic of
typographical style – is a variable with a preset value.  You are free
to alter this value, giving your score a different typographical
impression.

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

   Formatting rules are also preset variables: each object has variables
containing procedures.  These procedures perform the actual formatting,
and by substituting different ones, we can change the appearance of
objects.  In the following example, the rule governing which note head
objects are used to produce the note head symbol is changed during the
music fragment.

1.5 Putting LilyPond to work
============================

We have written LilyPond as an experiment of how to condense the art of
music engraving into a computer program.  Thanks to all that hard work,
the program can now be used to perform useful tasks.  The simplest
application is printing notes.

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

By adding chord names and lyrics we obtain a lead sheet.

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

   Polyphonic notation and piano music can also be printed.  The
following example combines some more exotic constructs.

      [image src="" alt="[image of music]" text="image of music" ]

   The fragments shown above have all been written by hand, but that is
not a requirement.  Since the formatting engine is mostly automatic, it
can serve as an output means for other programs that manipulate music.
For example, it can also be used to convert databases of musical
fragments to images for use on websites and multimedia presentations.

   This manual also shows an application: the input format is text, and
can therefore be easily embedded in other text-based formats such as
LaTeX, HTML, or in the case of this manual, Texinfo.  Using the
‘lilypond-book’ program, included with LilyPond, the input fragments can
be replaced by music images in the resulting PDF or HTML output files.
Another example is the third-party OOoLilyPond extension for
OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice, which makes it extremely easy to embed
musical examples in documents.

   For more examples of LilyPond in action, full documentation, and the
software itself, see our main website: www.lilypond.org.

1.6 Engraved examples (BWV 861)
===============================

This section contains four reference engravings and two
software-engraved versions of Bach’s Fugue in G minor from the
Well-Tempered Clavier, Book I, BWV 861 (the last seven measures).

this demonstrates slight variations in the engraving decisions, even
from the same publisher and edition:

     reports is a full description of music formatting.  As these
     largely depend on parameters of fonts, it starts with a verbose
     description of music symbols.  The subject is treated backwards:
     from general rules of typesetting the author tries to extract
     dimensions for characters, whereas the rules of typesetting (in a
     particular font) follow from the dimensions of the symbols.  His
     symbols do not match (the stringent) constraints formulated by eg.

     formulated.  The descriptions are long and verbose.  The verbosity
     shows that formulating specific rules is not the proper way to
     approach the problem.  Instead, the formulated rules should follow

     notes.  The measures can be arranged simultaneously or
     sequentially.  To address the 2-dimensionality, almost all
     constructs in MDL must be labeled.  MDL uses begin/end markers for
     attribute values and spanners.  Rightfully the author concludes
     that MusiCopy must administrate a "state" variable containing both
     properties and current spanning symbols.  MusiCopy attaches graphic
     information to the objects constructed in the input: the elements
     of the input are partially complete graphic objects.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
