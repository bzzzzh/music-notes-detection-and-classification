Introduction
************

Our Goal
--------

[png]
LilyPond came about when two musicians wanted to go beyond the soulless
look of computer-printed sheet music.  Musicians prefer reading
beautiful music, so why couldn’t programmers write software to produce
elegant printed parts?

   The result is a program that creates beautiful sheet music following
the best traditions of classical music engraving.  It takes care of the
details of layout programmatically, allowing composers, transcribers and
publishers to focus on the _music_ instead of improving their software’s
default output.  Performers will get parts that let them concentrate on
_playing_ music instead of _reading_ it.

Features
========

Excellent classical engraving
-----------------------------

[png]
LilyPond allows musicians to produce elegant sheet music that is easy to
read.  Its developer community has spent thousands of hours developing
powerful music engraving software that results in beautifully engraved
music.  All of LilyPond’s style settings, font designs and algorithms
have been inspired by the finest hand-engraved music.  LilyPond output
has the same strong, balanced and elegant look as the best-engraved
classical scores.  This is further explained in our *note Essay::.

Text input
----------

Everything is explicit
......................

LilyPond processes text input, which contains all information about the
_content_ of your score and can easily be read by any human or another
program.  There are no obscure settings hidden behind menu items and
binary file storage.

   Read more about this concept on *note Text input::.

Tweaks are robust and traceable
...............................

If you have to change anything in the layout this tweak will also be
explicitly visible in the input file in human-readable form, so you will
always be able to retrace what you’ve done.  If you should accidentally
break anything you can easily revert or modify any decision without
being at the mercy of an _Undo_ function.

Text files are failure- and future-proof
........................................

Text files are very robust against file corruption.  And as they are
human-readable, you will always be able to interpret them even if you
don’t have access to the programs that created them.

Manage your scores with version control
.......................................

Text files are applicable to be managed by version control.  Go for it
and experience infinite and selective undo/redo mechanisms and the full
development history of your scores.  Version control may also open up
new (collaborative) workflows for you.

Usability
---------

[png]
Effective layout choices
........................

Spend less time with tweaking the output; LilyPond gets the formatting
correct right from the start.  It determines spacing by itself, and
breaks lines and pages to provide a tight and uniform layout.  Clashes
between lyrics, notes, and chords are resolved and slurs and beams are
sloped, automatically!

Mix music and text
..................

Put fragments of music into texts without cutting and pasting pictures.
Integrate music into LaTeX or HTML seamlessly, or add music to
OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice with OOoLilypond
(http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/OOoLilyPond).
Plugins are also available to allow LilyPond code in various blogs and
wikis, making online collaboration possible.

Accessibility
.............

Text-based input also makes score-writing possible for users with severe
physical disabilities.  Dexterity-impaired users who are unable to type
or control a computer mouse can use speech-recognition software to edit
LilyPond files.  Even users who are totally blind can use screen-reading
software to write LilyPond files – an impossible task in graphical-based
score-writing programs.  You can see a spectacular score on *note
Examples::.

Editor diversity
................

Several developers, themselves active LilyPond users, have written tools
specifically aimed at making the process of editing LilyPond files
faster and more effective; you are not tied to a single user interface
but can use different tools for different tasks.  You can even use a
full-fledged LilyPond editor at home and use your mobile phone’s notepad
app to edit the files on the go.  For some examples, see *note Easier
editing::.

Extensible design
-----------------

Easy management of style sheets
...............................

All layout settings can be changed to suit your personal typographical
taste.  So you can easily write style sheets that change every aspect of
LilyPond scores’ default appearance.  As these are also written as text
and can be stored in separate files you can simply switch between two
stylesheets to produce scores with a completely different appearance or
layout.  You want to print a score on A4 paper and project it with a
beamer, one system per page?  LilyPond’s layout engine will effortlessly
produce both from the same input.

Add your own functions
......................

If that still is not enough, there is always the built-in scripting
language Scheme, which can access LilyPond’s layout engine at the same
level as LilyPond itself does, making it a _very_ powerful tool.
Settings, variables and functions are all documented in the
comprehensive program reference manual.

Process scores programmatically
...............................

LilyPond input files can fully be edited or even generated by programs
and scripts.  This can for example be used for algorithmical
composition.  But you can also access the musical content for analysis,
or manage input fragments in a database.  There are no limitations
except your imagination.

Create new tools using LilyPond
...............................

As LilyPond isn’t a monolithic GUI program but a command line tool it
can be used from within other applications too.  This way it is possible
to equip tools like e.g.  web applications with LilyPond’s engraving
power.  There already exist several online tools using LilyPond.

Environment
-----------

[png]
Excellent support
.................

LilyPond runs on all popular platforms: GNU/Linux, MacOS X, and Windows.
LilyPond comes with extensive documentation and hundreds of example
files.  There is an active user community answering questions on the
lilypond-user mailing list, offering you friendly help.  The response
time is usually very short, and often brillant solutions to reported
problems are developed.  Thanks to the close interaction with the
development team such solutions are regularly included in LilyPond
itself.  Read more in *note Community::.

Free software
.............

LilyPond can be downloaded free of charge!  Yep - It’s free.  Get it
from the download page.

   It’s also free (as in “speech”) software.  It comes with source code,
and permission to change and copy it.  So, are you irritated by a bug,
or yearning for a feature?  Simply add it yourself, or pay someone else
to do it.  Read more on *note Freedom::.

Examples
========

Beautiful Examples
------------------

LilyPond is a powerful and flexible tool for engraving tasks of all
kinds.  Please browse our gallery of examples and be inspired!

Classical Music
---------------

This organ work by J.S. Bach is a fairly typical engraving project in
LilyPond.

[bach-bwv610]
Complex Notation
----------------

This example from _Goyescas_ by Enrique Granados shows some of the more
advanced features of typesetting, including kneed beams, cross-staff
stems, and voice-follow lines.

[granados]
Early Music
-----------

LilyPond also supports various types of ancient notation, such as this
passage of Gregorian chant.

[ancient-headword]
Modern Music
------------

Contemporary composers find LilyPond well-suited to displaying unusual
notation.  Here is an excerpt from Trevor Bača’s _Čáry_, for
unaccompanied bass flute.

[cary]
Efficient, flexible creation of performance materials
-----------------------------------------------------

Various performance materials can be created from the same source code.
This is an excerpt of Nicolas Sceaux’s (http://nicolas.sceaux.free.fr/)
engraving of Handel’s _Giulio Cesare_, in full score, piano-vocal
reduction, and a violin part.

[sesto-full]
[sesto-piano]
[sesto-violin]
Tablature
---------

LilyPond supports tablature notation, which can be customized to suit
any instrument that reads from tablature.  The tablature staff is
generated automatically from notes entered for the 5-line staff.

[tab-example]
Vocal Music
-----------

LilyPond is excellent for vocal music of all kinds, from sacred hymns to
opera.  Here is a medieval motet with slightly unusual requirements.
The tenor voice is written in a different meter than the others, but
must line up as if it were in the same meter.  LilyPond handles this
most elegantly.  Note also the incipits with Vaticana style clefs, the
slashed stems indicating plicated notes, and the ligature braces above
certain groups of notes.

[aucun-snippet]
Lead Sheets
-----------

It is simple to create lead sheets with melody, lyrics, chord names, and
fretboards.  In this example you see some of the predefined fretboard
diagrams, but these can be heavily customized to suit nearly any
situation.

[chart]
Educational Applications
------------------------

LilyPond is perfectly suited for educational purposes as well.  Here is
an example of a simple counterpoint exercise.

[theory]
Large Projects
--------------

LilyPond is excellent for large projects like operas or works for full
symphony orchestra, as well.  In addition, the text-based input provides
greater accessibility – this example was contributed by Hu Haipeng, a
blind composer.

[orchestra]
Customized Output
-----------------

A short excerpt from Stockhausen’s Klavierstück II to demonstrate
LilyPond’s ability to provide customised output.

[stockhausen-klavierstueckII]
Schenker Graphs
---------------

Standard output can be modified heavily.  Here is an impressive
Schenkerian analysis, created by Kris Schaffer, for an article in Linux
Journal (http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8364).  The colors have
been added for better visibility.

Freedom::.  If you’ve already decided to try LilyPond, first read about
our *note Text input::.


File: lilypond-web.info,  Node: Freedom,  Next: Background,  Prev: Examples,  Up: Introduction

Freedom
=======

Free Software
-------------

GNU (http://www.gnu.org/) LilyPond is written and maintained by a
community of enthusiasts.  It is published under the *note GNU General
Public License: GPL. and the *note GNU Free Documentation License: FDL,
giving everybody the freedom to fix, modify, and extend the program.
Creating beautiful music should not require hundreds of dollars of
software!

What are the benefits to users?
-------------------------------

   • No cost: download and try it out!  What do you have to lose?

   • Sharing: if you like the program, give a copy to your friends,
     teachers, students, and colleagues!

   • Source available: if you are curious about how LilyPond creates
     some notation, you can see exactly how it is done.

   • Extendible: you can add features, fix bugs, and change the
     functionality.  If you are not a programmer, you can hire somebody
     to do those tasks.

     This may not seem appealing to casual musicians, but the ability to
     extend software can be highly valuable to serious composers,
     companies, and academics.

   • Future safety: if a commercial company goes bankrupt, what happens
     to any electronic music which depends on their products?  This is
     not a concern with LilyPond; even if the entire development team
     quits (extremely unlikely), the program will still be legally
     available for copying, modifications, and distribution.

Why do LilyPond developers “give away” their work for free?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Most of us view LilyPond development as a hobby or volunteer work.  So
this question is really asking “why do people volunteer”?

   • Fun: working towards a goal can be enjoyable, especially when you
     work as a team!

   • Shared goals: we all want beautiful sheet music, but few people
     have the expertise (and nobody has the time!), to create a program
     which can handle all situations.  By working together – one person
     improves the automatic beaming code, another person improves the
     shape of slurs, and a third person writes documentation explaining
     how to use these features – we can achieve our goal with only a
     fraction of the individual effort.

   • “Gift culture”: the Free Software movement has created many great
     software projects, such as GNU/Linux
     (https://www.gnu.org/distros/), Mozilla Firefox
     (http://www.getfirefox.com/), and Battle for Wesnoth
     (http://www.wesnoth.org/).  Having benefitted from these projects,
     some developers want to “give back” to the community.

   • Work experience: contributing to free software projects is a great
     way to practice programming, documentation writing, documentation
     translation, or design.  This experience has helped some developers
     gain job offers or scholarships.

productions, be it for performances of their music or as published
scores.  The list is limited to works released as public domain or under
open content licenses.

Performances and Concerts
-------------------------

LilyPond engravings have been used for performances around the world.
Some highlights:

   • Marc Hohl has written musical scores for children and adolescents.
     Engraved using LilyPond (with LaTeX) and available for free, in
     German, from <http://www.singspielschmiede.de/>, all of the music
     was performed on stage at the School where Marc works.

   • Aurélien Bello (http://www.aurelienbello.com/) arranged a version
     of Richard Strauss’s _Der Rosenkavalier_ for four singers and a
     chamber orchestra of thirteen players.  This was a commission by
     the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra who performed it in 2015 at the
     Baden-Baden and also at the Berlin.  We are pleased to see
     musicians of such reputation playing from LilyPond scores (who were
     reportedly very happy with them).

     Aurélien also re-orchestrated _Der Ring des Nibelungen_ by Richard
     Wagner for a family concert (ages 7 and above).  It was written for
     a standard symphony orchestra, but with a reduced cast of singers
     and was performed by the _Radio-Sinfonieorchester Berlin_
     (https://www.rsb-online.de/) in 2014 at the Atze Musiktheater,
     Berlin.  The Conductor was Heiko Matthias Förster.

     Another re-orchestration by Aurélien was Mussorgsky’s _Pictures at
     an exhibition_ which he also conducted for the Junge Philharmonie
     Brandenburg (https://junge-philharmonie-brandenburg.de/) in 2011
     and again in 2012.

   • Joe Smeets created sheet music for the children’s book _Zing Mee_
     (_Sing along_) by Annie M.G. published by _Querido_ – ISBN
     9789045106205.  He also worked on the score and parts for an
     arrangement of Mussorgsky’s _Boris Godunov_ for wind quartet, piano
     and percussion which was performed in 2014 by _Muziektheater
     Hollands Diep_.

     Joe also created the choir rehearsal scores for the Dutch
     translation of Benjamin Britten’s _Saint Nicolas_ which was
     performed in 2011 by _Muziektheater Hollands Diep_ see
     www.muziektheaterhollandsdiep.nl
     (https://muziektheaterhollandsdiep.nl/?s=sint+nicolaas+leeft).

   • Luca Rossetto Casel (https://unito.academia.edu/LucaRossettoCasel),
     for his Ph.D. thesis, created a critical edition of Tommaso
     Traetta’s _Enea nel Lazio (1760)_ opera series, with libretto by
     Vittorio Amedeo Cigna-Santi, in four parts: Part One
     (https://www.academia.edu/1987651/Enea_nel_Lazio_opera_riformata_prima_lazione_poi_le_parole_-_Partitura_1_4_)

“... I’ve written a couple of encore pieces for solo cello which I’ve
printed with LilyPond and which I’m going to submit to Schirmer for
publication.  I’ll bet their engraved version wouldn’t look half as
sharp as mine!”

Orm Finnendahl (http://icem-www.folkwang-hochschule.de/~finnendahl/), professor of Composition, Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst Frankfurt am Main
.............................................................................................................................................................

“Although I don’t know [LilyPond] very well yet, I’m **very* impressed.
I used the program to input a motet of Josquin Desprez in mensural
notation and there’s no doubt that lilypond outscores all other notation
programs easily concerning speed, ease of use and look!”

Darius Blasband, composer (Brussels, Belgium)
.............................................

“[..after the first orchestra rehearsal] I got numerous compliments
about the quality of the scores.  Even more importantly, while LilyPond
provides numerous hacks to improve the way its scores look, what the
orchestra got from me is basically the raw, untouched output.”

Kieren MacMillan, composer (Toronto, Canada)
............................................

“thanks and kudos to the development team for their incredible work.
I’ve never seen anything approaching the output that I get from LilyPond
– I’m totally confident that my music publishing needs will be fulfilled
beyond my expectations using this great application.  [...] basically
untweaked LilyPond output [...] looks better than most recent
‘professional’ publications I’ve compared it to (q.v., just about any
Warner Bros.  score, and even many of the most recent by ‘the old
houses’).  [...]” “Beat that, Finale/Sibelius/Igor/whatever!!!”

Chris Cannam, lead programmer of the RoseGarden (http://www.rosegardenmusic.com/) project
.........................................................................................

“LilyPond is obviously the zillion-ton gorilla [of great music
typesetting].”

Chris Snyder, Adoro Music Publishing (https://twitter.com/adoromusic)
.....................................................................

“The way that music is entered for LilyPond causes me to think in a more
musical way – there have been times when I’ve been stumped as to how to
tell Lily to engrave something, only to realize that even if I did get
it exactly as the composer wanted, the music would be confusing to read.
LilyPond makes it much easier for me to work in my dual editor+engraver
role.”

   “I’ve been using LilyPond exclusively for my fledgling music
publishing business.  Virtually without exception, every composer has
been blown away by the quality of the engraving when presented with the
proofs of their music about to be published.  I deserve some of the
credit for this – I spend a lot of time tweaking output, especially ties
(mainly in chords) – but LilyPond gives me an excellent starting point,
a very intuitive interface, and the ability to modify absolutely
anything if I want to take the time.  I’m convinced that no commercial
product can come close.”

David Bobroff, Bass Trombone, Iceland Symphony Orchestra
........................................................

“I think LilyPond is great [...] The more I learn about LilyPond the
more I like it!”

Vaylor Trucks, Electric guitar player (Yes, related to (http://www.allmanbrothersband.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=userpage&file=content&page_id=12))

   “THIS IS THE BEST PROGRAM EVER!!!”

   “Thank you all SO MUCH for your hard work and dedication!”

Nicolas Sceaux (http://nicolas.sceaux.free.fr/), Mutopia (http://www.mutopiaproject.org/) contributor
.....................................................................................................

“I had a kind of hate-passion relationship with it.  Passion because the
first score I saw was so amazing!  The description of LilyPond lies
about its beautifulness, it is too modest!  [...] as LilyPond is getting
always better, and as I look closer how things are done in scheme, I
have less and less frustrations.  Anyway, what I mean is: thank you for
providing LilyPond, it is really good.”

Werner Lemberg (http://www.troff.org/whoswho.html#werner), Conductor at the Theatre in Koblenz, Germany and distinguished GNU Hacker
....................................................................................................................................

“Anyway, LilyPond does an amazingly good job!”

Paul Davis, developer of JACK (http://jackaudio.org/) and Ardour (http://www.ardour.org/)
.........................................................................................

“I think [LilyPond is] an incredible program, and it produces wonderful,
wonderful output.  when i read an interview about it last year, i was
raving to several friends of mine about its potential.”

Dr. Mika Kuuskankare (http://webusers.siba.fi/~mkuuskan/), researcher at the Sibelius Academy Finland (http://siba.fi), composer and author of Expressive Notation Package (ENP)
................................................................................................................................................................................

“I have the deepest respect towards LilyPond and towards its creators
and maintainers as I know from personal experience how difficult this
kind of software can be.”

David Cameron (http://camerondh.blogspot.com), Musician, professional typesetter and long time SCORE user
.........................................................................................................

“My heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributes to this project.  I was
a power SCORE user for big typesetting houses way back in the ’90s, but
I feel LilyPond finally makes it possible for me to get exactly what I
want on the page, especially when it isn’t "standard" practice.”

Text input
==========

“Compiling” Music
-----------------

[nereid-shot-small]
LilyPond is a _compiled_ system: it is run on a text file describing the
music.  The resulting output is viewed on-screen or printed.  In some
ways, LilyPond is more similar to a programming language than graphical
score editing software.

   You do not write music by dragging notes from a graphical toolbar and
placing them on a dynamically refreshing score; you write music by
typing text.  This text is interpreted (or “compiled”) by LilyPond,
which produces beautifully engraved sheet music.

   People accustomed to graphical user interfaces might need to learn a
new way of working, but the results are definitely worth it!

          Note: We present a quick overview of our text input – it’s not
          as complicated as it sounds!  Don’t worry about understanding
          every detail in these examples; our beginner documentation
          covers everything at a much more gradual pace.

It’s as simple as A B C
.......................

Notes are encoded with letters and numbers.  Special commands are
entered with backslashes.

[png][png]
   Alterations are made with different names: add ‘-is’ for sharp, and
‘-es’ for flat (these are Dutch note names, other languages are
available).  LilyPond figures out where to put accidentals.

[png][png]
Pop music
.........

Put chords and lyrics together to get a lead sheet:

[png][png]
Orchestral parts
................

The input file contains the notes of piece of music.  Score and parts
can be made from a single input file, so that changing a note always
affects the score and parts.  To be able to include the same music in
multiple places, the music is assigned to a “variable” (a name).

[png]
   This variable is then used in a single part (here transposed, with
condensed rests spanning several measures):

[png][png]
   The same variable is used in the full score (here in concert pitch):

[png][png]
Beginner Documentation
......................

We realize that many users find this way of entering music a bit odd.
For this reason, we have written extensive documentation to help new
users, beginning with *note Learning::.  The Learning Manual is the best
place to start, as many questions are answered before they come up!

   Occasionally new users are unnecessarily confused by some aspects of
LilyPond’s behaviour.  Please read this manual before doubting whether
LilyPond is working correctly.

   More in-depth information is available in *note Manuals::.

   Ben Lemon, a LilyPond user, has created a range of video tutorials
(https://benl.xyz/lilypond/operation-lilypond) on his blog and which are
aimed at new users.

Easier editing environments
...........................

[lilykde-screenshot-small]
LilyPond is primarily concerned with producing top-quality engraved
sheet music; creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) would distract us
from this goal.  However, there are other projects aimed at making it
easier to create LilyPond input files.

   Some editing environments include syntax highlighting, automatic
command completion, and pre-made templates.  Other programs actually
provide a GUI which allows direct manipulation of a graphical score.

Running on the command-line
---------------------------

          Note: If you are happy with the GUI instructions below, then
          please ignore these instructions.

MacOS X on the command line
...........................

The most convenient way to run lilypond scripts is by setting up
“helper” scripts of your own.

  1. Create a directory to store these scripts,

          mkdir -p ~/bin
          cd ~/bin

  2. Create a file called ‘lilypond’ which contains

          #!/bin/bash
          exec DIR/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/bin/lilypond "$@"

               Note: DIR will generally be ‘/Applications/’

  3. Create similar files ‘lilypond-book’, ‘convert-ly’, and any other
     scripts you wish to use, by replacing the ‘bin/lilypond’ with
     ‘bin/convert-ly’ (or other program name).

  4. Make the file executable,

          chmod u+x lilypond

  5. Now, add this directory to your path.  Modify (or create) a file
     called ‘.profile’ in your home directory such that it contains

          export PATH=$PATH:~/bin

     This file should end with a blank line.

Invoking individual scripts
...........................

The scripts — such as ‘lilypond-book’, ‘convert-ly’, ‘abc2ly’, and even
‘lilypond’ itself — are included inside the ‘.app’ file for MacOS X.

   Scripts can also be run from the command line by invoking them
directly:

     PATH/TO/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/bin/lilypond

   The same is true for all other scripts in that directory, such as
‘lilypond-book’ and ‘convert-ly’.

Compiling a file
----------------

          Note: These instructions assume that you are using the
          LilyPond application.  If you are using any of the programs
          described in *note (lilypond-web)Easier editing::, consult the
          documentation for those programs should you have any problems.

Step 1. Create your ‘.ly’ file
..............................

Double click the ‘LilyPond.app’, an example file will open.

[lilypond/pictures/Learning_Macos_welcome]
   From the menus along the top left of your screen, select
‘File > Save’.

[lilypond/pictures/Learning_Macos_Save_menu]
   Choose a name for your file, for example ‘test.ly’.

[lilypond/pictures/Learning_Macos_Save_file_with_name]
Step 2. Compile (with LilyPad)
..............................

From the same menus, select ‘Compile > Typeset’.

[lilypond/pictures/Learning_Macos_Typeset_menu]
   A new window will open showing a progress log of the compilation of
the file you have just saved.

[lilypond/pictures/Learning_Macos_Compiling_log]
Step 3. View output
...................

Once the compilation has finished, a PDF file will be created with the
same name as the original file and will be automatically opened in the
default PDF viewer and displayed on your screen.

[lilypond/pictures/Learning_Macos_pdf_output]
Other commands
..............

To create new files for LilyPond, begin by selecting ‘File > New’

[lilypond/pictures/Learning_Macos_New_menu]
   or ‘File > Open’ to open and edit existing files you have saved
previously.

[lilypond/pictures/Learning_Macos_Open_menu]
   You must save any new edits you make to your file before you
‘Compile > Typeset’ and if the PDF file is not displayed check the
window with the progress log for any errors.

   If you are not using the default Preview PDF viewer that comes with
the Mac Operating system and you have the PDF file generated from a
previous compilation open, then any further compilations may fail to
generate an update PDF until you close the original.

Download
........

   • [lilypond/pictures/logo-windows]Windows: LilyPond 2.20.0-1
     (http://lilypond.org/download/binaries/mingw/lilypond-2.20.0-1.mingw.exe)
     For Windows 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7 and 8.

Install
.......

  1. Locate the downloaded file and double-click on it to start the
     installer.  Follow the instructions given to you by the installer;
     we recommend that you leave all the install options checked and use
     the default installation location.  Click the ‘Finish’ button when
     the installer has completed.  LilyPond is now installed.

Uninstall
.........

To uninstall LilyPond either:

  1. Locate the LilyPond folder from the ‘Start’ menu and click on the
     ‘Uninstall’ icon.  Click the ‘Finish’ button when the uninstaller
     has completed.

  2. Or from within the Control Panel, locate and select LilyPond and
     then choose the option to uninstall/remove the software.  Click the
     ‘Finish’ button when the uninstaller has completed.

Running on the command-line
---------------------------

          Note: If you are happy with the GUI instructions below, then
          please ignore these instructions.

Windows on the command line
...........................

The most convenient way to run LilyPond is by adding the folder which
contains LilyPond executable files to the environmental variable “Path”.

  1. Open your “System” on the Control Panel, select Advanced tab and
     click Environmental Variables button.

  2. Select the Variable “Path” from Environmental variables list and
     click the Edit button.  You will be presented a window titled “Edit
     System Variable”; append to “Variable value” the name of the folder
     which contains LilyPond executable files like this:

          [PRE-SET PATHS];DIR\LilyPond\usr\bin

               Note: DIR will generally be ‘C:\Program Files (x86)’ for
               64 bit or ‘C:\Program Files’ for 32 bit systems.

     and click “OK” button to close the window.

Invoking individual executable files
....................................

LilyPond executable files – such as lilypond, lilypond-book, convert-ly,
and so on – can be run from the command-line by invoking them:

     lilypond test.ly

Compiling a file
----------------

          Note: These instructions assume that you are using the
          built-in LilyPad editor.  If you are using any of the programs
          described in *note (lilypond-web)Easier editing::, consult the
          documentation for those programs should you have any problems.

Step 1. Create your ‘.ly’ file
..............................

Double-click the LilyPond icon on your desktop and an example file will
open.

[lilypond/pictures/LilyPad]
   From the menus that appear along the top of the example file, select
‘File > Save as’.  Do not use the ‘File > Save’ for the example file as
this will not work until you have given it a valid LilyPond file name.

[lilypond/pictures/FileSave]
   Choose a name for your file, for example ‘test.ly’.

[lilypond/pictures/SaveAs]
Step 2. Compile
...............

To turn your LilyPond file into a music score, you need to compile it.
This can be done a number of ways – using drag and drop, with
right-click, double-clicking or using the command line (a DOS box).
We’ll look at the first three to start with.

   1.  Drag-and-drop the file directly onto the LilyPond icon on the
desktop.

[lilypond/pictures/DragDrop]
   Not much will seem to happen, but after a short while, you should see
two new files on your desktop – ‘test.log’ and ‘test.pdf’.

   2.  Right-click on the file and from the pop-up context menu and
choose ‘Generate PDF’.

[lilypond/pictures/GenPDF]
   3.  Or simply double-click the ‘test.ly’.

Step 3. View output
...................

‘test.pdf’ contains the engraved ‘test.ly’ file.  Double-click it and it
should open in your PDF viewer:

[lilypond/pictures/PDFRead]
Other commands
..............

To create a new file, begin by selecting ‘File > New’ from within any
previously created file or ‘File > Open’ to open and edit any files you
have saved before.  You can also edit a file by right-clicking it and
selecting ‘Edit source’.

[lilypond/pictures/EditFile]
   You must save any edits you make before you try to compile your file.
If the PDF file is not created or the output is not what you expected,
check the log file that will have been created during the compilation
attempt for any errors.

[lilypond/pictures/BadLog]
   This log file is overwritten each time you compile your LilyPond
file.

   If you are viewing your file in a PDF viewer, then you must close the
PDF if you wish to try a new compilation as it may fail to create the
new PDF while it is still being viewed.

Software license
----------------

GNU LilyPond is published under the GNU General Public License.  An
introduction to this license, and our reasons for choosing it, is given
in *note Freedom::.

GNU General Public License
--------------------------

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users’ freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

  0. Definitions.

     “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
     “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

     To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified
     version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

     A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
     a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey
     the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
     form of a work.

     A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
     that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
     which an implementation is available to the public in source code
     form.  A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
     to control those activities.  However, it does not include the
     work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
     with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
     libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
     specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
     its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges
     your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
     copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
     or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided
     that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all
     material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making
     or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
     behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
     them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside
     their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
     limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
          written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to
          the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by
          you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the
          object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
          needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
     a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed
     by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
     modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the
     modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation
     of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
     terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked
          in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
     restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
     under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed
     by the terms of that license document, provided that the further
     restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
     third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
     for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
     of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in
     interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
     efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise
     of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
     litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
     alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
     selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
     of it.

  11. Patents.

     A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor
     version”.

     A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, “control”
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
     version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To “grant”
     such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
     commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
     you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
     activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
     grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
     from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
     copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
     those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
     products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
     entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
     prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
     or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
     do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you
     cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
     obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
     then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example,
     if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
     further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
     only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
     be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
     number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS”
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
===========================

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
“copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show w’.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.

   The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an “about box”.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

Learning
========

Learning manual
---------------

This book explains how to begin learning LilyPond, as well as explaining
some key concepts in easy terms.  You should read these chapters in a

   There is a paragraph *See also* at the end of each section, which
contains cross-references to other sections: you should not follow these
cross-references at first reading.  When you have read all of the
manual, you may want to read some sections again and follow those
cross-references for more information.

This book gives a brief history of music typography, followed by an
examination of LilyPond’s engraving techniques.  A comparison between
LilyPond and other music engraving systems is given.

          Note: the detailed typographical examples are easier to
          analyze in the PDF version due to its higher resolution.

Snippets
--------

This shows a selected set of LilyPond snippets from the LilyPond Snippet
Repository (http://lsr.di.unimi.it) (LSR). All the snippets are in the
public domain.

   Please note that this document is not an exact subset of LSR. LSR is
running a stable LilyPond version, so any snippet which demonstrates new
features of a development version must be added separately.  These are
stored in ‘Documentation/snippets/new/’ in the LilyPond source tree.

   The list of snippets for each subsection of the Notation are also
linked from the *See also* portion.

Introductory questions
----------------------

Where are the graphical canvas, menus, and toolbars?
....................................................

LilyPond requires you to write music as text.  Please read about our
*note Text input::.

There’s a lot of documentation! Do I need to read it?
.....................................................

You need to read the *note Learning manual: Learning.  As for the rest
of documentation, you only need to read the sections which discuss the
notation that you wish to create.

That’s still a lot of reading! Is it worth it?
..............................................

Please decide for yourself; the reasons why you might want to use
LilyPond are given in the *note Introduction::.

Usage questions
---------------

Something isn’t working! How do I fix it?
.........................................

This is explained in *note (lilypond-usage)Troubleshooting::.

Why do you change the syntax?

Internals

Internals reference
-------------------

This is a set of heavily cross linked pages which document the
nitty-gritty details of each and every LilyPond class, object, and
function.  It is produced directly from the formatting definitions in
the source code.

   Almost all formatting functionality that is used internally is
available directly to the user.  For example, most variables that
control thickness values, distances, etc., can be changed in input
files.  There are a huge number of formatting options, and all of them
are described in this document.  Each section of the Notation Reference
has a See also subsection, which refers to the generated documentation.

Documentation license
---------------------

The documentation for GNU LilyPond is published under the GNU Free
Documentation License.  An introduction to this license, and our reasons
for choosing it, is given in *note Freedom::.

GNU Free Documentation License 1.1
----------------------------------

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.

Tiny examples
=============

What are “Tiny examples”?
-------------------------

A tiny example is an example from which *nothing* can be removed.

Why create them?
----------------

   • The simpler the example is, the quicker potential helpers can
     understand it and help you.

   • A tiny example demonstrates that you have put effort towards
     solving the problem yourself.  When people send huge portions of
     input, it looks like they don’t care if we help them or not.

   • Creating a tiny example helps you to understand what is happening.
     Many false problem reports can be avoided by attempting to create a
     tiny example; if you cannot replicate a “bug” in a tiny example,
     then the problem was probably an insufficient understanding of
     LilyPond, not an actual bug!

How to create them?
-------------------

   • Include the ‘\version’ number.

   • Make it small!  Examples about spacing or page layout might require
     many bars of music, but most issues can be reproduced using less
     than a single measure.

   • When trying to create an example, try commenting out
     (‘%’ or ‘%{ ... %}’) sections of your file.  If you can comment
     something while still demonstrating the main idea, then remove the
     commented-material.

   • Avoid using complicated notes, keys or time signatures, unless the
     bug is about the behavior of those items.

   • Do not use ‘\override’ or ‘\set’ commands unless the bug is about
     those specific commands.

   • Optionally, attach an image showing the desired graphical output.

How tiny should they be?
------------------------

Is the code below a minimal example?

     \version "2.14.1"
     \include "english.ly"

     \score {
       \new Staff {
         \key d \major
         \numericTimeSignature
         \time 2/4
         <cs' d'' b''>16 <cs' d'' b''>8.
         %% Here: the tie on the D's looks funny
         %% Too tall? Left-hand endpoint is not aligned with the B tie?
         ~
         <cs' d'' b''>8 [ <b d'' a''> ]
       }
     }

   Well, it is not very big, but a truly minimal example is here:

     \version "2.14.1"
     {
       % middle tie looks funny here:
       <c' d'' b''>8. ~ <c' d'' b''>8
     }

   Very few tiny examples exceed 10 lines of code - quite often 4 lines
are enough to demonstrate the problem!

Bug reports
===========

If you have input that results in a crash or wrong output, then that is
a bug.

Step 1: Known bugs
------------------

We may already know about this bug.  Check here:

     <http://sourceforge.net/p/testlilyissues/issues/>

          Note: Please *DO NOT* add bug reports directly to the bug
          tracker.  Once an issue has been added to the tracker, feel
          free to add more information to that report.

Step 2: Creating a bug report
-----------------------------

If you have discovered a bug which is not listed, please help us by
creating a bug report.

          Note: We only accept reports in the form of *note Tiny
          examples::.  We have very limited resources, so any
          non-minimal example will be rejected.  Almost every bug can be
          demonstrated in four notes or less!

   Here is an example of a good bug report:

     % Accidentals should be printed for only
     % the first note in a tie, but this version
     % prints flats on both notes.
     \version "2.10.1"

     \relative c'' {
      bes1 ~
      bes1
     }

Step 3: Sending a bug report
----------------------------

Once you have verified that the issue is not already known and created a
bug report, please send it to us!

   Unfortunately there is no longer an interface for posting to the
bug-lilypond list without subscribing; see
     <https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-lilypond>
   for more information.

Step 4: Wait for a response
---------------------------

Once your bug report has been sent to the list, our Bug Squad will
examine it; they may ask you for more information.  You will be notified
when the report will be added to the bug tracker.  Please allow up to 4
days, as we have a limited number of volunteers for this task.

   Once a bug has been added to the tracker, you can comment it to add
more information about it.  In order to be automatically notified about
any activity on the tracker issue, you may subscribe by clicking the
envelope symbol next to the issue title.  Commenting and subscribing
require being logged in with a sourceforge account.

Optional help: show the desired behavior
----------------------------------------

Once an issue has been added to the tracker, it can be very helpful if
we can see the desired output.  Feel free to add input code and/or
images (possibly created with other tools) which demonstrate what you
think it should look like!

Help us
=======

We need you!
------------

Thank you for your interest in helping us — we would love to see you get
involved!  Your contribution will help a large group of users make
beautifully typeset music.

   Even working on small tasks can have a big impact: taking care of
them allows experienced developers work on advanced tasks, instead of
spending time on those simple tasks.

   For a multi-faceted project like LilyPond, sometimes it’s tough to
know where to begin.  In addition to the avenues proposed below, you can
send an e-mail to the lilypond-devel@gnu.org
(https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-devel) mailing list,
and we’ll help you to get started.

Simple tasks
------------

*No programming skills* required!

   • Mailing list support: answer questions from fellow users.

   • Bug reporting: help users create proper *note (lilypond-web)Bug
     reports::, and/or join the Bug Squad to organize *note
     (lilypond-contributor)Issues::.

   • Documentation: small changes can be proposed by following the
     guidelines for *note (lilypond-contributor)Documentation
     suggestions::.

   • LilyPond Snippet Repository (LSR): create and fix snippets
     following the guidelines in *note (lilypond-contributor)Adding and
     editing snippets::.

   • Discussions, reviews, and testing: the developers often ask for
     feedback about new documentation, potential syntax changes, and
     testing new features.  Please contribute to these discussions!

Advanced tasks
--------------

These jobs generally require that you have the source code and can
compile LilyPond.

          Note: We suggest that contributors using Windows or MacOS X do
          *not* attempt to set up their own development environment;
          instead, use Lilydev as discussed in *note
          (lilypond-contributor)Quick start::.

   Contributors using Linux or FreeBSD may also use Lilydev, but if they
prefer their own development environment, they should read *note
(lilypond-contributor)Working with source code::, and *note
(lilypond-contributor)Compiling::.

   Begin by reading *note (lilypond-contributor)Summary for experienced
developers::.

   • Documentation: for large changes, see *note
     (lilypond-contributor)Documentation work::.

   • Website: the website is built from the normal documentation source.
     See the info about documentation, and also *note
     (lilypond-contributor)Website work::.

   • Translations: see *note (lilypond-contributor)Translating the
     documentation::, and *note (lilypond-contributor)Translating the
     website::.

   • Bugfixes or new features: read *note
     (lilypond-contributor)Programming work::.

Sponsoring
==========

Bounties
--------

In the past,

   • some users have paid for new features
   • some developers have added new features for hire

   The LilyPond project does not organize such efforts; we neither
endorse nor discourage such agreements.  Any contracts between private
individuals is the business of those individuals, not ours.

Guidelines
----------

Any user wanting to offer money in exchange for work should bear in mind
the following points:

   • LilyPond developers may advertise their services on the lilypond
     email lists from time to time.

   • Any agreements between private individuals should include the
     normal precautions when conducting business: who pays, how much do
     they pay, with what method of payment, and upon what set of
     conditions.  We suggest that any ambiguity or uncertainty in these
     questions should be resolved before any work begins.

Interested developers
---------------------

Here is a list of people who have expressed an interest in bounties.
Note that the amount of work done by individuals varies quite a bit
throughout the years.  We do not guarantee that this list is up-to-date,
nor do we guarantee that the people listed here have any ability.  The
only criteria is "XYZ asked to be listed on this page".

   Looking at the git history is a good way to determine who the most
active and experienced developers are.  Statistics up to version
2.19.84:

overall history        past year              past three months
(http://lilypond.org/~graham/gitstats-all/)(http://lilypond.org/~graham/gitstats-1year/)(http://lilypond.org/~graham/gitstats-3months/)

   Interested developers:
LilyPond developer list <lilypond-devel@gnu.org>
     Since no developer currently is listed for commercial development,
     your best bet is asking on the developer list.

Development
===========

Development for LilyPond 2.20.0
===============================

          Note: These are _unstable development_ versions.  If you have
          the slightest doubt about how to use or install LilyPond, we
          urge you to use the *note stable Download: Download, and read
          the *note stable Manuals: Manuals.

Release numbers
---------------

There are two sets of releases for LilyPond: stable releases, and
unstable development releases.  Stable versions have an even-numbered
‘minor’ version number (e.g., 2.14, 2.16, 2.18).  Development versions
have an odd-numbered ‘minor’ version number (e.g., 2.15, 2.17, 2.19).

Google Summer of Code
=====================

What is Google Summer of Code?
------------------------------

GSoC (https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program that
offers students stipends to write code for free software and open source
projects during the summer.  For three months students work to complete
a given task as part of the project’s community and under the guidance
of experienced mentors.  The program is an excellent opportunity for
students to gain experience with real-world software development and
make a contribution that benefits everyone.  It brings new contributors
to LilyPond and enables students who are already involved to become more
involved.  LilyPond participates in GSoC as part of the GNU project
(http://www.gnu.org/).

   We have had GSoC participants in 2012, 2015, 2016 and 2017.  This
site is current for the 2018 program.

Project Ideas List
------------------

Below is a list of GSoC project ideas (last update: May 2017), but if
you have other ideas for a project you may complete within the three
months of the program you’re welcome to make a suggestion on our
developer mailing list (see *note Contact::).  There are a number of
areas where LilyPond could be improved, and our development team is
always willing to help those who would like to tackle a project similar
to those listed below.  As mentor availability varies from project to
project and from year to year it is wise to get in touch with us as
early as possible.

   Per 2018 we have installed the new role of “Community Mentor”.  We
aim at assigning one Community Mentor to each active project who is
_not_ responsible for discussing the implementation or reviewing the
code.  Instead they will on the one hand discuss the _design_ of the
planned features from the (power) user perspective, and they will look
after the communication between student and mentor, and between the two
and the community.

   A full list of all the current open issues can be found here
(http://sourceforge.net/p/testlilyissues/issues/).

Adopt the SMuFL music font encoding standard
............................................

For several years now a new standard for music fonts has been around:
SMuFL (http://www.smufl.org/), which is also discussed as becoming part
of a future W3C standard for music encoding.  As a FLOSS tool LilyPond
should adhere to such an open standard instead of using an isolated
solution like it does today.  Adopting SMuFL will help integrating
LilyPond with the world of music notation software and eventually give
LilyPond users access to a wider selection of notation fonts.

   Making LilyPond compliant to SMuFL includes remapping of the glyphs
that are built from METAFONT sources, adjusting the glyphs’ metrics to
SMuFL’s specifications, and finally updating the way LilyPond looks up
and positions the glyphs.  As an optional part of this project
LilyPond’s font loading mechanism could be modified to use notation
fonts installed as system fonts instead of inside the LilyPond
installation.

   _Difficulty_: Easy/medium

   _Requirements_: C++ and willingness to get familiar with LilyPond
internals.

   _Recommended_: Interest and experience in working with font files.  A
little bit of METAFONT.

   _Mentors:_ Werner Lemberg, Abraham Lee

Adding variants of font glyphs
..............................

   • Adding ‘on’ and ‘between’ staff-line variants.

   • Shorter and narrower variants of some glyphs for example,
     accidentals.  Another, more specific example could be an ancient
     notation breve notehead coming in two variants one with a small or
     big ‘hole’ within it.

   _Difficulty:_ easy

   _Requirements:_ MetaFont, C++, good eye for details

   _Recommended knowledge:_ basic LilyPond knowledge

   _Mentor:_ Werner Lemberg

Improve/Extend Export to MusicXML
.................................

There is experimental support for exporting scores to MusicXML. So far
there is limited coverage that should be extended, and the export should
become more robust with regard to unconventionally organized input
files.  Several strategies can be thought of in that regard.

   Significant progress in coverage has been made in a GSoC Project
hosted by Frescobaldi (http://frescobaldi.org) in 2017, but there is
still much to be done that could make a nice GSoC project.

   Working in this project will mainly be done in the python-ly
(https://github.com/wbsoft/python-ly) repository.

   _Difficulty:_ easy to hard (depending on the targeted improvements)

   _Requirements:_ Python, MusicXML

   _Mentor_: Peter Bjuhr

Rewrite LibreOffice LilyPond Extension with Python
..................................................

The OOoLilyPond (http://ooolilypond.sourceforge.net/) extension made it
possible to conveniently include LilyPond score snippets in
OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice Writer, Draw and Impress documents while
keeping source and image together.  After many years without development
an initial effort has started to make the extension compatible again
with current versions of LibreOffice and LilyPond.

   However, as the LibreOffice ecosystem has changed substantially it is
now possible to rewrite the extension with Python and PyQt.  This will
not only be more powerful in general but will allow the integration of
functionality from Frescobaldi (http://frescobaldi.org), such as for
example syntax highlighting, entry helpers, score wizards or musical
transformations.

   _Difficulty:_ easy/medium

   _Requirements:_ Python, PyQt, LilyPond basics, LibreOffice extension
basics

   _Recommended knowledge:_ Familiarity with Frescobaldi code based or
willingness to learn during bonding period

   _Mentor(s):_ Joram Berger, Urs Liska, (Thorsten Behrens/LibreOffice)

Fix Beaming Patterns/Beam Subdivisions and Tuplets
..................................................

Subdivision is an important way to improve the readability of beamed
music.  However, despite several attempts at fixing it LilyPond still
does not always produce correct results.  In order to properly fix this
issue it seems necessary to rewrite the responsible code from the ground
up.  Much work has already been done assessing the issue (see this
discussion
(http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/lilypond-devel/2017-11/msg00037.html)
and this work-in-progress document
(https://openlilylib.org/public/beam-subdivisions.pdf)).

   In the course of this assessment it has been found that LilyPond’s
conception of _tuplets_ is somewhat flawed as well (see this discussion
(http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-lilypond/2017-11/msg00016.html)),
and that this has to be fixed as well.

   _Difficulty:_ medium

   _Requirements:_ C++

   _Recommended knowledge:_ Good musical and mathematical understanding
of timing issues

   _Mentors:_ Urs Liska, Carl Sorensen

Support for Style Sheets
........................

LilyPond’s engraving output can be tweaked to the least detail, and one
important addition in recent years was the ability to use alternative
notation fonts.  It is possible to create reusable modules for “house
styles”, but this project aims at bringing this to a new level by
creating a convenient extension package with support for creating,
applying, and sharing modular style sheets.  We are looking for a
hierarchical structure that allows to mix and match style elements for
“house” (e.g.  “my-personal-style”, “client-a”, “client-b” etc.), score
type, paper size etc.

   Work can be built upon the existing notation-fonts
(https://github.com/openlilylib/notation-fonts) openLilyLib package.  We
would like to see a further improvement of the loading mechanism for
notation fonts (for example a better separation of loading notation and
text fonts) as part of the project, and optionally (this would involve
working on Lilypond’s C++ code) support for notation fonts that are
installed system-wide.

   _Difficulty:_ medium

   _Requirements:_ Scheme, aesthetic competence

   _Recommended:_ sense of building hierarchical frameworks

   _Optional:_ C++ (for font loading internals)

   _Mentor:_ _Abraham Lee_

   _Community Mentor:_ _Kieren MacMillan_

Contemporary Notation
.....................

LilyPond is very good at creating non-standard notation.  Having to
_code_ every graphical element instead of simply _drawing_ it may seem
cumbersome but is in fact a strong asset.  New notational functionality
can be provided with consistent appearance, automatic layout and a
natural syntactic interface.

   Within the openLilyLib (https://github.com/openlilylib/oll-core)
library system the student will create a fundamental infrastructure and
building blocks to make creating contemporary notation easier.
Additionally (at least) _one_ concrete package is developed to cover
specific contemporary notation, such as for example the style of a given
composer, extended playing techniques for a specific instrument or a
certain category of effects.

   _Difficulty:_ medium

   _Requirements:_ Scheme (interaction with LilyPond internals),
contemporary notation techniques

   _Recommended:_ sense of building hierarchical frameworks

   _Mentors:_ _NN,_ Urs Liska

Extending scholarly editing features
....................................

The scholarLY (https://github.com/openlilylib/scholarly) extension
package provides a powerful infrastructure for scholarly editions.  With
this package it is possible to encode annotations, to export them for
critical reports, or to produce editorial highlighting in the score
(e.g.  dashing, parenthesizing etc.), footnotes etc.

   As a GSoC project substantial enhancements can be made to the
package.  Our suggestion is an infrastructure to encode _variants_
(alternative readings, corrections, regularizations), as outlined in
this issue (https://github.com/openlilylib/scholarly/issues/61).  It
could naturally be extended by the ability to produce music examples
from annotations, to be used in footnotes or reports.

   _Difficulty:_ medium

   _Requirements:_ Scheme, ability to assess an extensive existing
package

   _Recommended:_ familiarity with scholarly editing

   _Mentors:_ Jeffery Shivers, Urs Liska

Implement a System to Handle Scores System by System
....................................................

One strategy that may improve the issue of LilyPond’s compilation time
is to handle scores in a system-by-system manner through partial
compilation.  This project explores one approach to achieve this and may
lay the ground for future development towards a “LilyPond server”.  It
is very ambitions because it involves working with LilyPond’s internals
and optionally a reference user interface in Frescobaldi
(http://frescobaldi.org).

   The idea behind this project is the implementation of a music viewer
that doesn’t display pages but sees a scores as a continuous sequence of
systems that are stitched together.  LilyPond can produce such a
sequence of files, and it can be made aware of the moments of each line
break.  That way only systems have to be recompiled that are affected by
a modification, thus saving significant waiting times.  Optionally there
could be new engraving modes in LilyPond that don’t try to optimize the
line breaking, saving even more time, at least while in content editing
mode.

   The project is fairly complex and has many more aspects than could be
listed on this page.  So if you are interested in this please get in
touch with us as early as possible to evaluate options and discuss the
topics before you write an application.

   _Difficulty:_ hard

   _Requirements:_ LilyPond/Scheme, Python/PyQt

   _Optional:_ C++ if it’s necessary to modify LilyPond itself

   _Mentors:_ NN (, Urs Liska)

   _Community Mentor:_ Kieren MacMillan

Information for Applicants/Participants
---------------------------------------

In order to have a satisfying experience with GSoC applicants are
strongly advised to thoroughly read the following recommendations.  Some
of these are relevant for the application process, others for the time
within the project.

   • Read all applicable information on the program’s website,
     particularly the students’ manual
     (https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/manual).
     Make sure you fulfil all of Google’s prerequisites and are willing
     to join the program as a full-time commitment over the coding
     period of three months.

   • Please get in touch with us as soon as possible if you are
     interested in applying with a project.  Mentor availability may
     change without notice, project proposals may need fine-tuning, and
     many other reasons might require us to reject or ignore an
     application that hasn’t been discussed before.

   • We do not know in advance how many “slots” we will have available
     for projects, so please be aware that you may find yourself in
     competition with other applicants or not.  Interested or even
     enthusiastic response from our mentors is no guarantee of
     eventually being accepted, and _not_ being accepted does not
     necessarily indicate a negative evaluation of your application.  If
     we have to decide between different applicants there may be various
     aspects to consider.

   • Integration in the LilyPond community is a fundamental part of
     GSoC, and we expect our students to make substantial efforts to
     become community members.  Within the _bonding period_ we expect
     you to write a blog post about your project (either on Scores of
     Beauty (http://lilypondblog.org) or on any other blog) and to be
     active on our mailing lists, introducing yourself but also
     communicating about unrelated tasks.  This goes beyond the mere
     setting up of a working environment and familiarizing yourself with
     the relevant code, but we think it is crucial for the GSoC project
     to be mutually satisfying.

   • If you are accepted to the program you will have one mentor
     explicitly assigned to your project.  With this mentor you will
     have to agree upon a communication strategy, be it emails,
     chatrooms, issue trackers or voice/video chats.  Regular
     communication is absolutely crucial for the success of a GSoC
     project so you are stricly required to keep talking to your mentor.
     But keep in mind that your mentor has explicitly taken over the
     responsibility for your project, and while unlike you he isn’t paid
     for this activity you are still entitled to get regular attention
     from him.

   • In order to get support from your mentor you have to give him a
     chance to follow your progress and efforts.  Therefore it is
     important to regularly commit your changes to the versioning
     repository you are working on.  Don’t hesitate making unfinished
     code available because you are afraid of criticism, and don’t
     suppress questions because you think they might be considered
     stupid.  But ideally your code should at any time be accompanied by
     compatible testing code.  Your mentor may not be able to properly
     assess your code by only _reading_ it without the opportunity to
     apply it in a real example.

   There is a list of inactive projects in the *note Attic::.  We list
projects there that are still considered valuable but for which there
are currently no mentors available.

Inactive Google Summer of Code project suggestions
--------------------------------------------------

The following list describes GSoC projects that had been proposed in
recent years and which are still considered valuable but for which we
currently don’t have mentors available.

Automated testing and documentation for openLilyLib
...................................................

openLilyLib (https://github.com/openlilylib) is an extension framework
for LilyPond code providing a “snippets” repository and a suite of
integrated packages such as for example page layout tools or scholarly
annotations.  It is very powerful and promising, but to really get off
the ground two features are missing: automated testing and documentation
generation.

   Automated testing is necessary to ensure modifications to
functionality don’t break other functions within the library.  There is
already some Automated Testing of the “snippets” repository with
Github’s Travis server, but this has to be reconsidered and extended to
cover the standalone packages too.

   In order to be usable for a wider range of LilyPond users on a
“consumer level” openLilyLib needs proper documentation.  This
documentation has to be generated from the sources, so a system is
needed that requires package authors to document the input files and
provide additional usage examples, from which documentation is
generated.  Ideally but not necessarily this is implemented as a Git
hook, i.e.  automatically upon each update to the repository.  We don’t
prescribe the tools and approaches to be used, but the most widely used
language in the LilyPond domain is Python, so there would be some bias
towards that.  Alternatively a Scheme solution could be fine so
generating the documentation would actually be triggered by “compiling”
a certain LilyPond input file.  In general it is advisable to make use
of proven concepts and tools from other languages.

   The eventual output of the documentation should be a static HTML site
that can be viewed locally and/or uploaded to a website.  But it would
be beneficial if the tool would first generate an intermediate
representation (e.g.  a JSON file with additional media files) from
which a Single Page Application could retrieve content for display on
openLilyLib’s website (https://openlilylib.org).  Development of such a
SPA _can_ be part of the GSoC project, but is optional.

   _Difficulty:_ medium

   _Requirements:_ Python or Scheme, static website generator(s) or
(Node.js based) dynamic web application technology.  Continuous
Integration (can be learned during the bonding period)

MusicXML
........

Improving MusicXML import and export functions:

   File interchange between LilyPond and other applications using
MusicXML is still a difficult matter.  To import MusicXML it has to be
converted manually by the ‘musicxml2ly’ script.  Export _to_ MusicXML is
only available as a rudimentary feature inside Frescobaldi.  In order to
provide natural interchange between LilyPond and MusicXML based
applications there’s the need of actual import functionality and a
dedicated export backend.

   Importing XML shall provide file, line and column to add origin
attributes to generated objects.  That way point and click can be made
available in Frescobaldi or other supported IDEs.

   Exporting XML shall be realized with an exporter class like the MIDI
export.  This may be based on the work already done in GSoC 2015
(https://github.com/DavidGarfinkle/Lilypond_MusicXMLexport) by David
Garfinkle.  It should be checked if it is possible to use another XML
library than the one provided by guile-2 in order to have this feature
available in current LilyPond (which is based on guile-1.8).

   _Difficulty:_ medium

   _Requirements:_ MusicXML, Python, Scheme, basic LilyPond knowledge

   _Recommended:_ Familiarity with other scorewriters (for
cross-testing)

Improve slurs and ties
......................

The engraving quality of slurs and ties is often unsatisfactory.  Ties
‘broken’ by clef or staff changes are not handled well.  The project
could include collecting and sorting examples of bad output, deciding on
the intended output and writing code to improve them.

   _Difficulty:_ hard

   _Requirements:_ C++, experience with writing heuristics

   _Recommended knowledge:_ LilyPond knowledge, aesthetic sense

Grace notes
...........

Fix problems with synchronization of grace notes.  Grace notes can
interfere with LilyPond’s timing and cause odd effects, especially when
multiple staffs are used where some have grace notes and others don’t.
This is one of the longest-standing and one of the more embarrassing
bugs (https://sourceforge.net/p/testlilyissues/issues/34/) in LilyPond.

   _Difficulty:_ medium

   _Requirements:_ C++, MIDI

   _Recommended:_ familiarity with LilyPond internals

Improve default beam positioning
................................

For regular, cross-staff, broken and kneed beams.  Beaming should depend
on context and neighbor notes (see section 2.2 of this book
(http://imslp.org/wiki/Repository_of_Music-Notation_Mistakes_%28Coulon%2C_Jean-Pierre%29)).
If possible also reduce beaming-computation time.

   _Difficulty:_ medium

   _Requirements:_ C++, experience with writing heuristics

   _Recommended knowledge:_ aesthetic sense

Help improve compilation behavior
.................................

Automatic code analysis tools, like valgrind memory leak detection or
callgrind code profilers, provide valuable information about possible
flaws in our C++ code.  Cleaning up warnings would allow us to automate
the rejection of any patch which introduced extra warnings.

   _Difficulty:_ medium

   _Requirements:_ C++

Two LilyPond projects in Google Summer of Code 2016 _April 23, 2016_
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We are happy to see two students, Nathan Chou and Jeffery Shivers,
working on LilyPond as participants in the Google Summer of Code this
year.  We hope they produce great results and stay in the developer
community afterwards.

   Nathan will tackle an annoying limitation, namely the unability of
spanners to cross voices.  His work will make a class of ugly
workarounds obsolete.  Jeffery will bring the ScholarLY package[1] to
production quality and add a LaTeX package to it, making it possible to
create beautiful critical reports from data encoded directly in the
LilyPond score.

is a music engraving program devoted to producing the highest-quality

   Among the numerous improvements and changes, the following might be
most visible:

   • Many items are now positioned using their actual outline rather
     than a rectangular bounding box.  This greatly reduces the
     occurrence of unsightly large gaps.

   • Sets and overrides can now use the syntax
          \override Voice.TextSpanner.bound-details.left.text = "rit."
     instead of the previous
          \override Voice.TextSpanner #'(bound-details left text) = "rit."

   • Triplets with a given group length can now be written as
          \tuplet 3/2 4 { c8 c c  c c c }
     instead of
          \times 2/3 { c8 c c }  \times 2/3 { c8 c c }

   A full list of noteworthy new features is given in:

We are proud to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.14.  LilyPond is

     much more flexible and easier to control.

LilyPond 2.5.7 is out.  This release has a completely usable Pango
integration for the PS backend.  The default font is Century Schoolbook
from the PS font suite.  It also has small updates to the tablature
settings by Erlend Aasland, assorted manual updates by Graham, and an
overhaul of the font code by Werner.  *note Old downloads:: and check

January 02, 2005
----------------

LilyPond 2.5.6 was released.  This is a "technology preview" release,
which means that it has all kinds of nifty features, but is not actually
usable for producing nicely printed scores.  For this reason, an RPM of
this release was not produced.  The PS backend is now completely
switched over to Pango/FontConfig: for -f ps, LilyPond only accepts UTF8
input, all text fonts are loaded through Pango, the TeX backend now
offloads all metric computations to LaTeX, the SVG and GNOME backends
are broken, most probably.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the

December 28, 2004
-----------------

LilyPond 2.5.5 is out.  It is the first one to link against FontConfig
and Pango, although it is only available in the "-f ps" output.  The
default output format has been changed back TeX while we stabilize the
Pango/FontConfig integration.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the

December 20, 2004
-----------------

LilyPond 2.5.4 is out.  This release has some major brainsurgery in the
font handling.  As of now, LilyPond loads the music fonts in OpenType
font format using FreeType.  This has made a lot of things simpler,
including font handling for the GNOME backend and SVG backend.  *note

December 3, 2004
----------------

LilyPond 2.5.3 was released.  A new script, ‘\espressivo’ has been
added, for a combination of crescendo and decrescendo on a single note.
In markups, expressions stacked with ‘\column’, ‘\center-align’, etc,
are not grouped with ‘< ...  >’ anymore, but with ‘{ ...  }’.  LilyPond
will now avoid line breaks that cause long texts to stick outside of the
page staff.  Grace notes following a main note, used to be entered by
letting the grace notes follow a skip in a parallel expression.  *note

November 26, 2004
-----------------

LilyPond 2.5.2 was released.  It has several goodies, including
solfa-notation (shaped noteheads), and an easier mechanism for
customizing title, footer and header layout.  Don’t forget to rebuild
the fonts, as they have been changed to accomodate the solfa-notation.

November 20, 2004
-----------------

LilyPond 2.5.1 is out.  This is an experimental release, containing some
proof-of-concept code for our graphical layout editor.  You can add and
remove things from the file, and the tweaks will still work, as long as
the tweaked notes remain in the place (ie.  start at the same time-wise
and be part of the same context).  Further attractions are: the gnome
backend now also draws beams and slurs, updates to the SVG backend,
support for the lmodern font set for TeX, various bugfixes.  *note Old

November 12, 2004
-----------------

The LilyPond development is OPEN once again!  The first release of the
2.5 series has the following new Features: Positioning of slurs can now
be adjusted manually, Grace notes are correctly quoted and formatted
when using cue notes, Cue notes can now be created with

\cueDuring #VOICE-NAME #DIRECTION { MUSIC }

   Stemlets (short stems over beamed rests) have been added.  In
addition, Jan hacked together some highly experimental code where you
can use the mouse to drag and drop objects in the -f gnome backend.
These tweaks can be saved and are applied to the PS and TeX output as
well.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the changes in the ChangeLog

September 20, 2004
------------------

LilyPond 2.3.18 was released.  It has further improvements in the slur
formatting, and a small syntax change: the mode changing commands
(‘\chords’, ‘\lyrics’, etc.)  have been renamed to ‘\chordmode’,
‘\lyricmode’, etc.  The command ‘\chords’ is an abbreviation for \new
ChordNames \chordmode ...  ‘\drums’, ‘\lyrics’, ‘\chords’, ‘\figures’
function similarly.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the changes in

September 11, 2004
------------------

LilyPond 2.3.16 was released.  It fixes a couple of annoying bugs, and
has an important addition in the slur-formatter.  Slurs that pass note
heads much closer than the average distance get an extra penalty.  This
fixes a lot of difficult slurring cases.  See input/regression/new-slur
for some examples.  Please consider this release as a 3.0 pre-release so
try to find as many bugs as possible.  A report including a small .ly
example can be filed at bug-lilypond@gnu.org In this case, a bug is
defined as something that the current 2.3 does worse than the latest 2.2
release.  We want to be sure that no output will get uglier by upgrading
to 3.0, so that once 3.0 is out, nothing will hold users back in
switching.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the changes in the

September 10, 2004
------------------

LilyPond 2.3.15 was released.  It fixes for some gaffes with the new
vertical spacing engine, has lots of documentation updates, and has
support for landscape output in the direct postscript output.  Also, the
types of events quoted with ‘\quote’ can now be tuned with
‘quotedEventTypes’.  By default, only notes and rests end up in quotes.

September 6, 2004
-----------------

LilyPond 2.3.14 was released and has exciting features!  LilyPond will
try to keep staves at the same distances across a page, but it will
stretch distances to prevent collisions; key signature cancellations are
now printed before the bar line; different voices that all use "\quote"
can now refer to each other.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the
changes in the ChangeLog

August 29, 2004
---------------

LilyPond now has a Documentation Editor, Graham Percival.  From now on,
he will oversee that useful information flows from the mailiing list
into the manual.  Also, if there are unclear sections in the manual, let
him know via one of the mailing lists.  As a start of his career, he
worked to transform the "Templates" section of the website into a
readable and comprehensive chapter of the user manual.  A lot of cheers
for Graham!

August 29, 2004
---------------

LilyPond 2.3.13 was released.  The new slur code was improved, scripts
can be made to avoid slurs, by setting inside-slur to #f.  It is no
longer necessary to instantiate "up" and "down" staves separately when
using \autochange.  Jurgen Reuter refreshed the logic around mensural
flags, so they are adjusted for staff lines once again.  *note Old

---------------

LilyPond 2.3.12 is out.  This release has a lot of fixes and a new

above and below.  This is switched on with the ‘doubleSlurs’ property.

August 1, 2004
--------------

LilyPond 2.3.10 is out.  This release has a major clean-up of the
input/test/ directory.  Many examples have been moved to the regression
test or manual, and the superfluous or outdated ones have been removed.
The directory has gone from 146 examples to 72 examples.  That means
that we’re halfway cleaning it out.  Incidentally, the manual has gone
from 200 to 220 pages.  New features:
   • Running trills now have their own spanner and event.  They are
     started and stopped with \startTrillSpan and \stopTrillSpan
   • There is a new markup command ‘\postscript’ that takes a string
     that is dumped as verbatim PostScript

July 30, 2004
-------------

LilyPond 2.3.9 is out.  The important change is that lilypond now
once-again directly runs the binary.  The old wrapper script has been
renamed to lilypond-latex.py, and should only be used for legacy
projects.  The recommended route is either using lilypond directly (with
\book, you can have multiple movements within one document), or to run
lilypond-book with a LaTeX wrapper file.  This release also fixes a
bunch of small errors.  I now consider LilyPond feature complete for a
3.0 release.  Next on the TODO list is updating the manual, and after
that’s done we can release 3.0.  The projected date for this to happen
is in about a month.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the changes in

July 23, 2004
-------------

LilyPond 2.3.8 fixes a few minor bugs in the new slur code, and has
rewritten support for ledger lines.  Now, in tight situations, ledger
lines will be shortened so they stay separate.  This also required a
cleanup of the Ambitus implementation.  *note Old downloads:: and check

July 19, 2004
-------------

LilyPond 2.3.7 was released and has new exciting features!  The slur
formatting has been rewritten.  The new slur code works similar to the
Beam formatter: scores are assigned for all esthetic components of a
slur.  A large number of combinations for begin and end points is then
tried out.  Slurs will now also take into account collisions with staff
lines, scripts (like staccato and accent) and accidentals.  In the
LilyPond emacs mode, the ‘|’ will now display the current beat within
the measure.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the changes in the
